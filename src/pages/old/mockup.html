            <h2>Mockup Presentation of our Game Project</h2>
            <p>By Marc Vergères the 7/04/2024 at 17:00</p>

            Behold the mockup of our game, showcasing a more refined view of the
            game's aesthetics. These images represent a closer step towards the
            final design, illustrating how the game elements might coalesce into
            an engaging interface. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Dive into 'Duck Dash', an exhilarating world where adventure beckons
            with every click. The home screen, a gateway to fun, features two
            standout buttons – 'Start', catapulting you into the heart of the
            action, and 'Scores', a showcase of your gaming prowess. These
            aren't just buttons; they're your first steps on a journey to the
            top, your opportunity to make a mark on the leaderboards. Adjust the
            volume to set the tone of your adventure, and then off you go – will
            you just play, or will you conquer?
          </p>

            class="inTextImg"
            src="ressources/images/homescreenGame.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            With a focus on pixel art, the mockup displays an elevated level of
            detail and color, bringing the game world to life. The main
            character, the perky duck, now appears more vivid against the
            dynamically rendered environment. Cars, roads, grass patches, trees,
            water bodies, and logs are depicted with enhanced clarity, hinting
            at the game's interactive potential. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The composite game scene at the bottom gives a snapshot of the
            gameplay experience, offering a slice of the immersive world we are
            crafting. The pixel-perfect alignment and thoughtful placement of
            elements promise an experience that's both nostalgic and fresh. This
            mockup is not only a glimpse into the game's visual direction but
            also a testament to our commitment to creating a captivating and
            harmonious game world for our players.

            Immerse yourself in the thrill of competition with our game's
            comprehensive score leaderboard. Displayed prominently are the
            player's attempts, each paired with the score achieved. This vibrant
            scoreboard isn't just a tracker of individual progress; it's the
            fuel for the competitive fire within. As players vie for supremacy,
            every score submitted is a step toward personal glory, encouraging
            them to surpass their previous bests and ascend the leader's ranks.
            Navigate back at any time to continue refining your strategy and
            gameplay, as you scale new heights and carve your name at the top of
            the scoreboard.

          <p>
            Step into the sound settings of your gaming experience with our
            intuitive volume menu. Here you can adjust the 'General Volume' to
            your preference, ensuring the audio levels are just right for your
            adventure. The slider is designed for ease of use, allowing you to
            increase or decrease the volume with a simple drag. Once you've
            fine-tuned your audio settings, simply hit 'Back' to return to the
            main menu and continue with your game, now with the perfect audio
            backdrop to match your play style.

            And with that, our journey through the digital landscape comes to a
            pause. Whether you’re navigating through scores, tweaking the
            volume, or preparing for another round in the vibrant realm of 'Duck
            Dash', each click is a step in your unfolding adventure. Here's to
            the challenges and triumphs that await in the pixels and sound waves
            of the gaming universe. Until next time, keep playing, keep
